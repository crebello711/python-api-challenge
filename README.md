## Background

Whether financial, political, or social&mdash;data's true power rests in its ability to answer questions definitively. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter ..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

### Check out the following for ```Weather``` Analysis
* [Weather output figures](WeatherPy/Images) to review the insights
* [Weather Data File](WeatherPy/OutputFiles) to review the extracted data from API
* [Sample Solution](WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb) to review the challenge

### Check out the following for ```Hotels``` in ```Vacation``` analysis 
* [Sample Solution](VacationPy/VacationPy.ipynb) to review the challenge
